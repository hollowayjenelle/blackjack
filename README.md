This is a follow along project by Scrimba. This project is a simple display of the game Blackjack.

The user will be given 2 random cards once the start game button is clicked. They can then select a new card until they hit Blackjack (21) or until they bust (over 21). They can start a new game if they have reached or exceeded 21. 

This project was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript
